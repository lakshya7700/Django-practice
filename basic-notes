Django based on MVT 

MVT is a software design pattern.

M->Model
Model acts as interface of data that we store/take in our database

V->View
The view is the user interface- what you see in your browser when you render a website

T->Template
A template consists of static parts of desired HTML file as well as some special syntax describing how 
dynamic content will be inserted.

## To create new project in django
-> django-admin startproject <Project name>

## To run our project
-> python manage.py runserver
this manage.py is in our project directory mys

Default port djnago project is run on: 8000

Port 8000 is commonly used, and other frameworks or applications might also be configured to run on this port.
If two frameworks attempt to use the same port simultaneously, only one will run successfully, while the other will fail.

# To run on different port
-> python manage.py runserver <any port number>

Django use sqlite as default database.

To create our HTML file, we have to create Templates folder and in that we will create HTML file.

We also have to crete static folder which will have all static files.
For eg: js, css, fonts, images file etc...

Then we create media folder which will have all the dynamic files.

## inside our app folder: /mys/settings.py
this is an important file, all the settimgs related to project is present in this only.
if we want to use different db, other than sqlite, we do that there.
We have to share the path of all template files, static files in this only.

## inside our app folder: /mys/urls.py
In this we add all our urls of our project. 
For eg: We created home page, menu page whatever as per our project requirements. We add it to this file.

## views.py
Another file is created, views.py which has all the functions of the urls. urls.py and views.py are connected.
