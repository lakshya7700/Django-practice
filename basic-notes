Django based on MVT 

MVT is a software design pattern.

M->Model
Model acts as interface of data that we store/take in our database

V->View
The view is the user interface- what you see in your browser when you render a website

T->Template
A template consists of static parts of desired HTML file as well as some special syntax describing how 
dynamic content will be inserted.
